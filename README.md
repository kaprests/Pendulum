# Pendulum
Numerical exercise in TFY4345 at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology

This is a project in the course TFY4345 "Classical Mechanics" at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The notebook studies a simple pendulum, comparing the results of different numerical methods for solving the pendulum's equation of motion.

The file pendulum.html is a rendered version of the notebook where all cells have been run, and can be viewed here:

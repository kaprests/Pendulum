# Pendulum
Numerical exercise in TFY4345 at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology

This is a project in the course TFY4345 "Classical Mechanics" at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and it is made up of notebooks studying the kinematics of a pendulum. The first notebook studies a simple pendulum, comparing the results of different numerical methods for solving the pendulum's equation of motion, while the second takes a look at damped and forced oscillations.

Pre-rendered versions of the notebooks can be viewed here:
